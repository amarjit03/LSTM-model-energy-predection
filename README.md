## Introduction
This project aims to predict energy consumption using an LSTM model, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for time series forecasting. The model is trained on historical energy consumption data to make future predictions.

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/amarjit03/LSTM-model-energy-predection.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd LSTM-model-energy-predection
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies. It's recommended to use a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Run the notebooks in the desired order to train and evaluate the LSTM model.
